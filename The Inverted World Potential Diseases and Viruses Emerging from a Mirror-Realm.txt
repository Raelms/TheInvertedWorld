Abstract

The Inverted World (I.W) is a dimension that exists as a colour-inverted replica of the Real World (R.W), devoid of life but scattered with skeletal remains. This study explores the potential biological hazards, including diseases and viruses, that may originate from the I.W. It examines the theoretical development of pathogens within a realm exposed to constant inversion and the effects of Phase Gate transference on human health and biology. This analysis discusses whether the I.W could harbour unique biological agents that might impact human populations should contamination occur.

1. Introduction

The study of potential biological threats from the Inverted World (I.W) is largely speculative due to the lack of observable life forms. However, theories suggest that prolonged human exposure or the importation of elements from the I.W through Phase Gates may yield unforeseen biological consequences. Given that skeletal remains from the R.W are present in the I.W, some speculate that pathogens, or even unique forms of diseases, could develop in this hostile, lifeless environment. Understanding these threats is crucial for ensuring the safety of individuals who may inadvertently pass through a Phase Gate.

TL;DR: We are exploring if the Inverted World could pose health risks, despite the absence of life, through unknown diseases or pathogens affecting people who cross Phase Gates.

2. Environmental and Biological Inversion

The I.W’s complete chromatic and environmental inversion creates a unique setting that may foster the mutation of known pathogens or lead to the emergence of entirely new ones. While traditional life forms cannot survive there, it is conceivable that microscopic organisms, such as extremophilic or endolithic microbes, may adapt to the inverted environment, developing harmful properties when reintroduced to the R.W. Additionally, the lack of natural light and altered atmospheric conditions might favour the evolution of anaerobic or radiation-resistant microbial life.

Hypothesis: Pathogens exposed to the extreme and inverted conditions of the I.W could undergo mutations, developing novel properties and posing a threat if accidentally transported back to the R.W.

TL;DR: The I.W’s harsh, inverted conditions could cause microbes to mutate, potentially becoming dangerous if brought back to the Real World.

3. Phase Gate Transmission and Pathogen Carriers

Phase Gates could serve as conduits for microbial contamination, inadvertently transporting mutated pathogens or spores between realms. Travellers who pass through these gates risk exposure to radiation and unknown biological agents. If skeletal remains in the I.W are carriers of dormant or evolved pathogens, Phase Gate traversal may act as a vector, introducing these agents into the R.W. Symptoms and diseases arising from exposure may manifest as radiation-like poisoning or unknown infections.

Hypothesis: Phase Gates may inadvertently transfer hazardous biological agents, resulting in diseases that manifest uniquely due to dimensional exposure.

TL;DR: People passing through Phase Gates could unknowingly carry mutated pathogens, resulting in strange and possibly severe illnesses.

4. Potential Diseases and Symptoms

Possible diseases originating from the I.W could present with symptoms that defy known medical conditions. These could include:

1. Inverted Radiation Sickness: A condition resembling radiation poisoning but caused by energy unique to the I.W. Symptoms may include skin discoloration, neurological disruptions, and cellular decay.
2. Temporal Displacement Syndrome: A disorder caused by altered biological rhythms due to time irregularities in the I.W. Symptoms may involve hallucinations, severe insomnia, and memory loss.
3. Ectoplasmic Bone Decay: A speculative disease theorised to cause bone degradation, mimicking the skeletal remains found in the I.W. Victims may experience severe bone density loss and chronic pain.

Hypothesis: The extreme conditions of the I.W could lead to diseases that are unprecedented in their symptoms, possibly affecting the central nervous system, bones, and overall cellular integrity.

TL;DR: Exposure to the I.W might cause diseases like radiation-like sickness or bone decay, with effects that could be severe and hard to treat.

5. Quarantine and Containment Strategies

Should Phase Gate traversal become more frequent or predictable, stringent quarantine measures would be necessary to contain any potential biological hazards. Protocols could include decontamination of travellers, isolation of transported materials, and regular health monitoring. Researchers suggest developing technology capable of scanning for inverted pathogens and preventing contamination from crossing realms.

Hypothesis: Proactive containment strategies will be crucial to mitigate the risk of cross-realm biological contamination, especially if human exploration becomes more common.

TL;DR: To prevent disease outbreaks, strict quarantine and decontamination protocols are essential for anyone travelling between realms.

6. Conclusion

The Inverted World presents a potential biological threat despite its lack of life. Mutated or evolved pathogens could pose serious health risks if transported to the R.W. Without further research and improved detection technologies, the health hazards associated with Phase Gate transference remain speculative yet concerning.

TL;DR: The I.W might hide unknown diseases, making travel between worlds risky until we understand and can manage the health threats.
